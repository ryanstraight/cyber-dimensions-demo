The assessment framework recognizes that cybersecurity emerges through networks of human and technological actors, not just individual expertise. Learning objectives focus on complex sociotechnical analysis rather than memorizing frameworks."

    "text": "How This Actually Works\nHere’s the thing about traditional cybersecurity education: it’s mostly theoretical frameworks, coding simulations, compliance checklists, and sanitized case studies that miss the fundamental reality of how cybersecurity incidents actually unfold through complex networks of human actors, technological systems, organizational politics, and regulatory pressures. All of these interact in ways that can’t be captured by teaching students to memorize the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. This approach is different.\nArtifact-based learning means students work with realistic documents instead of reading about incidents or requiring access to virtual environments. They examine SCADA logs. They read email threads between confused managers. They analyze regulatory filings and media coverage. Multiple stakeholder perspectives emerge naturally when you have technical staff reporting one thing while management says another. Authentic complexity develops as students trace how real-world incident progression involves coordination failures and response delays. Posthuman assessment recognizes that cybersecurity expertise is distributed across human and technological networks, not contained within individual minds.\nThe trick is using deliberately crafted educational materials rather than authentic historical documents—I can target specific learning objectives without the ambiguity that derails student learning. The fictional artifacts guide students toward insights about infrastructure security and stakeholder coordination while maintaining enough complexity to feel real. Here, I’m using Google Gemini 2.5 (Imagen & Pro Preview TTS) to generate media components when needed.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\nBroudy, H. S. (1991). Case studies and the engaged learner.

This is more sophisticated than typical attacks we see - these actors have detailed knowledge of SCADA systems and smart grid architecture.\nThey conducted coordinated reconnaissance from multiple IPs (203.45.67.89, 198.51.100.42, 192.0.2.146) and specifically targeted our industrial protocol ports - Modbus 502, DNP3 20000. The packet captures show they understand our communication protocols and successfully mapped our OT network topology before attempting access.\nImpact assessment: they identified three Landis+Gyr E470 concentrators with default credentials and gained partial visibility into our grid monitoring capabilities before automated isolation engaged. Attack was contained at the smart meter communication level and did not reach core SCADA control functions.\nHowever, they now possess detailed knowledge of our grid architecture. The smart grid modernization has created new attack surfaces that require specialized response capabilities.\nThis incident exceeds our normal response protocols. Recommend immediate escalation:\nContact Carlos Mendoza at Phoenix Edison for emergency technical support - their contract covers advanced threat response for critical infrastructure.\nCoordinate with Arizona Corporation Commission cybersecurity division for state-level threat intelligence and regulatory compliance. This triggers 72-hour reporting requirements.\nConsider engaging DHS ICSERT for federal threat assessment and coordination with other affected utilities.\nCurrent protective status: automated segmentation maintaining grid operational security, enhanced monitoring active across all OT segments, grid stability maintained throughout incident.\nJennifer - this requires incident commander designation and multi-agency coordination beyond our internal capabilities.\nMaria\nMaria Santos\nIT Manager\nRibera Municipal Utilities Information Technology Division\nOffice: 480-555-0198 | Mobile: 480-555-0123\nSecure Email: maria.santos@riberamu.gov"

Someone—or something—was methodically testing the industrial protocols that keep the lights on for 18,500 customers. Not random ransomware kids or cryptocurrency miners. This was different. Surgical. Professional.\nThe attackers spoke fluent Modbus and DNP3, the arcane digital languages that smart meters use to whisper secrets about power consumption back to the grid. They knew exactly which virtual doors to rattle, which network pathways led to the city’s electrical jugular.\nThey just didn’t expect the grid to fight back.\n“Our systems lit them up immediately,” says Maria Santos, Ribera Municipal Utilities’s IT manager, with the satisfied tone of someone whose paranoia just paid off. “By the time they realized we were watching, they were already locked out.”\n\nWelcome to the Smart Grid Wars\nWhat happened in Ribera is the nightmare scenario that keeps infrastructure security experts awake at night. It’s also proof that the nightmare might actually have a happy ending—if you build the defenses right.\nAmerica’s electrical grid is in the middle of a massive digital transformation. Cities like Ribera have spent the last few years replacing dumb analog meters with smart digital ones that can report power usage in real time, detect outages instantly, and help balance renewable energy sources. The $8.2 million Ribera has invested since 2022 bought them 12,000 smart meters and a web of sensors that would make a Tesla jealous.\nBut every smart device is a potential doorway for attackers. And these attackers clearly did their homework.\n“This wasn’t some script kiddie messing around,” says David Kim, the utility’s power system operator. “They understood our industrial control protocols better than most of our own technicians. They knew exactly which digital conversations to eavesdrop on.”\n\n\nThe Pattern Emerges\nHere’s where the story gets interesting—and scary. Ribera wasn’t the only target.\nThe National Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Agency has been tracking similar digital reconnaissance across southwestern utilities for weeks. Same techniques. Same industrial protocol knowledge. Same methodical approach to mapping smart grid vulnerabilities.\nFederal cybersecurity analysts won’t name names, but the technical sophistication screams nation-state actors. This isn’t about stealing credit card numbers or demanding Bitcoin ransoms. Someone is systematically cataloging how America’s newly digitized electrical infrastructure works—and where it’s vulnerable.\n“We’re seeing coordinated intelligence gathering,” says City Manager Jennifer Walsh. “It’s the kind of long-term strategic thinking that makes us very concerned about what comes next.”\n\n\nThe Transparency Dilemma\nLocal advocacy group Ribera Energy Watch finds itself in an awkward position: celebrating that the city’s defenses worked while demanding to know exactly how vulnerable they really are.\n“We’re glad the systems worked, but we’re also realizing that connecting our electrical grid to the internet creates risks we never had to think about before,” says spokesperson Patricia Chen. “How do we balance transparency with security?”\nIt’s the classic cybersecurity catch-22: The more the public knows about defensive measures, the more potential attackers learn too. The group plans to request a public briefing at the next City Council meeting, but don’t expect too many details.\n\n\nThe Digital Chess Match\nThe technical details read like a cyberpunk thriller. The attackers didn’t just randomly probe for weaknesses—they methodically mapped the utility’s network architecture, testing how smart meter clusters communicate with central control systems.\nThey tried to exploit the trust relationships between devices, the digital equivalent of convincing a security guard that you belong in the building because you’re wearing the right uniform. In the industrial control world, devices authenticate each other through protocols like Modbus TCP and DNP3—languages that were designed decades ago for closed networks, not internet-connected smart grids.\nBut Ribera’s defenses were ready. Machine learning algorithms trained to recognize normal network behavior immediately flagged the unusual patterns. Automated isolation protocols kicked in, essentially amputating potentially compromised network segments while keeping the lights on.\n“It’s like having an immune system for your electrical grid,” explains Maria Santos. “The moment something looks wrong, the network quarantines itself.”\nThe response required instant coordination between municipal staff, regional vendor Phoenix Edison, state regulators, and federal cybersecurity teams. It worked because everyone had practiced this exact scenario.\n\n\nThe Bigger Picture\nWhat happened in Ribera is a preview of the infrastructure wars coming to every connected city in America.\nUtilities nationwide are pouring billions into smart grid modernization, connecting everything from home thermostats to industrial transformers to the internet. It’s necessary—climate change and renewable energy integration demand intelligent, responsive electrical systems. But it also creates millions of new attack surfaces for sophisticated adversaries.\n“Every smart meter is essentially a computer connected to the internet,” explains Carlos Mendoza from regional vendor Phoenix Edison. “Multiply that by thousands of devices across hundreds of utilities, and you start to understand the scope of what we’re defending.”\nThe paradox is that smart grids are both more vulnerable and more defensible than the analog systems they’re replacing. Old electrical infrastructure was air-gapped and isolated, but it was also blind. Modern smart grids can see attacks coming and respond automatically—if they’re designed right.\n\n\nWhat’s Next?\nRibera’s successful defense is already influencing federal policy discussions about infrastructure cybersecurity standards and funding. The incident proves that local utilities can build effective defenses against nation-state actors, but it also shows how much coordination that requires.\nThe city plans public information sessions about smart grid security, walking the delicate line between transparency and operational security. Meanwhile, federal investigators continue mapping the broader attack campaign.\nOne thing is certain: this won’t be the last time a smart grid fights back against digital invaders. The only question is whether other cities will be as ready as Ribera was.\n“We built our defenses assuming we’d eventually be tested,” says City Manager Jennifer Walsh. “Yesterday, we found out our paranoia was justified.”\n\nRelated Coverage:\n\nEditorial: Smart Grid Security Requires Community Support\nAnalysis: Federal Infrastructure Investment and Cybersecurity Policy\n\nLocal Impact: How Smart Grid Modernization Affects Utility Bills\n\nContact Information:\nQuestions about this story?

    "title": "CIRCUIT: Assessment Framework",
    "section": "Prerequisites and Conceptual Framework",
    "text": "Prerequisites and Conceptual Framework\n\nWhat You Need Before Starting\nBefore engaging with this assessment framework, students should understand:\n\nBasic cybersecurity concepts: Threat detection, incident response, vulnerability management\nIndustrial control systems fundamentals: SCADA, HMI, OT/IT networks (see Section 2.2 for refresher)\nAcademic analysis skills: Close reading of technical documents, evidence-based argumentation\nCritical theory foundations: Familiarity with questioning traditional assumptions about technology and society\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCognitive-load-alertCognitive Load Management\n\n\n\nThis assessment integrates multiple challenging domains simultaneously. If students seem to be struggling, focus first on understanding the technical artifacts (Section 2.2) before moving to posthuman theoretical applications. The worked example in Section 2.4 demonstrates integration strategies.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Background\nTo effectively analyze the CIRCUIT artifacts, you need familiarity with industrial control system architecture and cybersecurity practices in critical infrastructure contexts.\nSCADA Systems (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) monitor and control industrial processes like power generation and distribution. These systems collect data from sensors across the infrastructure and allow operators to adjust settings remotely. Modern SCADA implementations integrate with business networks while maintaining operational isolation.\nHuman-Machine Interface (HMI) systems provide the graphical displays and controls that operators use to interact with SCADA systems. HMIs translate automated system data into human-readable formats and allow operators to override automated responses when necessary.\nOT/IT Network Architecture: Operational Technology (OT) controls physical processes like opening circuit breakers or adjusting voltage levels. Information Technology (IT) manages data communications and business processes. Smart grid modernization increasingly integrates these previously separate domains.\nIndustrial Communication Protocols: Unlike standard internet protocols, industrial systems use specialized communications including Modbus (serial communication for device networking), DNP3 (power system automation), and EtherNet/IP (industrial Ethernet). These protocols prioritize reliability and deterministic timing over flexibility.\nSmart Grid Infrastructure enhances traditional electrical systems with two-way digital communication capabilities. Smart meters, automated switching systems, and distributed energy resources create new capabilities for grid optimization—and new attack surfaces for cybersecurity threats.\n\n\nPosthuman Cybersecurity Concepts\nThe assessment framework applies theoretical concepts that may be unfamiliar from traditional cybersecurity education. These concepts require careful application to avoid oversimplification.\nAssemblages are heterogeneous networks of human actors, technological systems, protocols, and institutions that produce outcomes through their relationships rather than through individual capabilities. In cybersecurity contexts, security emerges from assemblage dynamics rather than from human decisions or technological features alone.\nKey insight: Don’t think of assemblages as “teams” or “systems.” They’re dynamic networks that form and reform based on specific situations. The Ribera Municipal Utilities response assemblage included automated SCADA responses, human operator expertise, vendor support networks, regulatory compliance requirements, and federal coordination—all operating simultaneously.\nDistributed Agency recognizes that both humans and non-human actors (technologies, protocols, institutions) participate actively in producing outcomes. This differs from treating technology as neutral tools that humans control or autonomous systems that replace human judgment.\nKey insight: Look for moments where technological systems make decisions independently (automated threat isolation) AND where human expertise is essential (interpreting alerts within operational contexts). Agency distributes across these relationships rather than residing in individual actors.\nResponse-ability (Donna Haraway’s concept) refers to relational responsibility that emerges through network relationships rather than individual accountability. Response-ability involves the capacity to respond appropriately to others (human and non-human) within specific situations.\nKey insight: Instead of asking “Who was responsible for security?” ask “How did different actors demonstrate response-ability to each other throughout the incident?” This shifts focus to relational ethics rather than individual blame.\nMaterial-Semiotic Practices recognize that technical systems and meaning-making practices co-constitute each other. Technologies don’t just implement human intentions—they actively shape what becomes possible to think and do.\nKey insight: Smart grid technologies don’t just make infrastructure “more efficient”—they transform what infrastructure governance means, who participates in it, and how cybersecurity gets practiced.\n\n\nWorked Example: Posthuman Analysis of SCADA Logs\nTo demonstrate how posthuman concepts apply to technical cybersecurity artifacts, consider this brief analysis of SCADA alert patterns from the Ribera Municipal Utilities incident:\nTraditional Analysis Approach\n\n“At 14:23:07, the SCADA system detected unauthorized access attempts and alerted human operators, who then decided to isolate affected substations.”\n\nPosthuman Analysis Approach\n\n“The 14:23:07 SCADA alerts demonstrate distributed agency operating across human-technology assemblages. The automated systems didn’t simply ‘detect’ threats—they actively participated in threat assessment by correlating multiple sensor inputs, comparing patterns against baseline operations, and prioritizing alerts based on grid stability algorithms. Simultaneously, human operators David Kim and Maria Santos brought interpretive capabilities that allowed them to contextualize these alerts within broader operational knowledge, including understanding of equipment maintenance schedules and regional load patterns that automated systems couldn’t access.\nThe isolation response emerged through assemblage coordination rather than individual decision-making. Automated protocols initiated preliminary isolation procedures based on threat severity algorithms, while human expertise guided selective overrides to maintain power delivery to critical services like . Neither humans nor technologies could have achieved effective threat containment independently—security emerged through their relational coordination.”\n\nKey Differences:\n\nMoves from sequential causation (system detects → human decides → action happens) to relational emergence\nRecognizes both automated and human contributions without privileging either\nShows how security outcomes emerge from assemblage coordination rather than individual capabilities\nAvoids both techno-solutionism (“better systems solve problems”) and anthropocentrism (“humans control technology”)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaffolding-tipApplying This Approach\n\n\n\nWhen analyzing artifacts, look for moments where:\n\nMultiple actors contribute simultaneously to outcomes\nTechnologies make independent decisions that shape what becomes possible\nHuman expertise complements rather than controls technological capabilities\n\nCoordination emerges dynamically rather than following predetermined procedures\nResponsibility distributes across networks rather than residing in individuals\n\nUse specific artifact evidence to demonstrate these dynamics rather than simply asserting they exist.\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nThrough this engagement with posthuman cybersecurity methodology, students develop competencies that extend beyond traditional human-centered or technology-focused approaches to infrastructure protection, demonstrating sophisticated understanding of how agency distributes across sociotechnical networks while simultaneously developing practical capabilities for analyzing multi-stakeholder coordination challenges that emerge during critical incidents. Students will:\n\nTrace distributed agency patterns across automated systems, human expertise, and organizational protocols during critical infrastructure incidents\nMap multi-stakeholder coordination networks as they form and evolve across municipal, vendor, regulatory, and federal response domains\nApply posthuman ethics frameworks to responsibility distribution in complex sociotechnical systems. This means abandoning individual blame.\nDesign response strategies that work with assemblages rather than treating technology as neutral tool\nAnalyze technical communication and media mediation by examining how cybersecurity incidents become transformed through tech journalism practices and public discourse formation"

    "text": "Welcome to CIRCUIT\nOn March 15, 2024, at precisely 2:17 PM, automated security systems at Ribera Municipal Utilities in Ribera, Arizona detected sophisticated unauthorized access attempts targeting the municipal power grid’s industrial control systems. What unfolded over the following 72 hours reveals the complex web of human expertise, technological agency, and inter-organizational coordination that defines modern critical infrastructure cybersecurity.\nThis case study presents authentic artifacts from the incident response—from the initial SCADA alerts through federal advisories and media coverage. Each document demonstrates how cybersecurity emerges not just from human decision-making or technological capabilities alone, but through the dynamic assemblages that form when automated systems, human operators, vendor networks, regulatory agencies, and community stakeholders coordinate in response to infrastructure threats."

    "text": "Learning Through Authentic Artifacts\nMost cybersecurity case studies give you a tidy narrative written after the fact. CIRCUIT drops you into the messy reality of an active incident. You’ll read the actual SCADA logs that first detected the attack, follow email threads as staff figured out what was happening, and listen to conference calls where decisions got made under pressure.\nThe collection includes regulatory filings showing how utilities must document incidents, federal advisories that warn other infrastructure operators, and media coverage that translates technical complexity into public concern. Each document type reveals different aspects of how cybersecurity actually works in critical infrastructure."

    "section": "Posthuman Cybersecurity Perspective",
    "text": "Posthuman Cybersecurity Perspective\nThe traditional view treats cybersecurity as humans using technology tools to solve problems. But when you examine what actually happened during this incident, something more complex emerges. The SCADA systems didn’t just alert human operators—they made their own decisions about isolating compromised components and maintaining grid stability. Human experts didn’t just override the technology—they worked symbiotically with automated systems to interpret alerts and coordinate responses.\nThis blurs the lines between human agency and technological capability. Security emerges from the relationships between people, systems, protocols, and institutions rather than from any single actor. When something goes wrong, responsibility gets distributed across these networks rather than landing on one person’s decision."

    "text": "Learning Objectives\nAfter working through the CIRCUIT artifacts, you’ll be able to trace how security emerges from interactions between automated systems, human expertise, and organizational protocols. You’ll see how infrastructure incidents require coordination across multiple organizations—utilities, vendors, regulators, and federal agencies—each with their own priorities and capabilities.\nThe case also develops skills in assessing responsibility when both humans and technologies participate in security outcomes. Where does accountability lie when an automated system makes critical decisions during an incident? How do you design response strategies that work with technological agency rather than against it?"

    "section": "Methodological Background",
    "text": "Methodological Background\n\nAssemblage Theory in Infrastructure Security\nCritical infrastructure cybersecurity doesn’t happen inside any single organization or system. It emerges from networks that span municipal utilities, vendor support, state regulation, and federal oversight. These networks form what theorists call “assemblages”—dynamic relationships between human actors, technological systems, protocols, and institutions that produce security outcomes together.\nThe Ribera Municipal Utilities incident shows this in action. SCADA systems detected threats and initiated responses automatically. Human operators interpreted those alerts within broader operational contexts. Vendor networks provided technical expertise that exceeded internal capabilities. Regulatory frameworks shaped how the incident got documented and reported. None of these actors could have managed the incident alone.\n\n\nPostphenomenological Ethics\nSmart grid technologies aren’t neutral tools that humans simply use to solve cybersecurity problems. They actively reshape what cybersecurity means and how it gets practiced. The artifacts show how these technologies amplify some security capabilities—automated detection can spot threats faster than human monitoring. But they also reduce others—operators lose direct oversight of system interactions that happen too quickly for human intervention.\nMore fundamentally, smart grid technologies transform infrastructure governance itself. They create new stakeholder relationships, change the temporal rhythms of incident response, and shift the boundaries between human and technological decision-making."

    "text": "Technical Context\nIf you’re new to industrial control systems, a few terms will help you navigate the artifacts. SCADA stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition—these systems monitor and control industrial processes like power generation and distribution. HMI means Human-Machine Interface, which is how operators interact with automated systems through screens and controls.\nYou’ll also see references to OT and IT networks. Operational Technology controls physical processes (like opening circuit breakers), while Information Technology manages data and communications. Industrial systems use specialized protocols like Modbus and DNP3 instead of standard internet protocols. The smart grid refers to electrical infrastructure enhanced with two-way digital communication and automated control capabilities."

The SCADA logs reveal automated systems making real-time decisions about threat response. Email threads show human operators interpreting those decisions within broader operational contexts. Conference call transcripts capture cross-organizational coordination under time pressure.\nWhat becomes clear is that effective incident response doesn’t happen through either human expertise or technological capability alone. It emerges from the relationships between people, systems, protocols, and institutions working together. Current infrastructure modernization decisions create both new vulnerabilities and enhanced protective capabilities that will shape how future incidents unfold."
